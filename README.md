<h1>Overview</h1>
This project is a cutting-edge application that combines history, technology, and entertainment to deliver an interactive and immersive learning experience. By utilizing Augmented Reality (AR), music, location-based exploration, and an intuitive interface, users can travel through time and space to explore iconic landmarks and significant historical events. Our goal is to transform how users learn about history, offering them a platform that blends education with personalized engagement.

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<h3>1. Home Page</h3>
The application opens with a clean, user-friendly home page.
Users are greeted with six distinct options, which include:
Architectural Structures: Explore famous landmarks like the Taj Mahal, Colosseum, and Eiffel Tower.
Historical Events: Step into pivotal moments in history, including eras like the Jurassic period and others.
Each option includes concise details to provide users with a brief overview, helping them make informed choices.

<h3>2. Location-Based Exploration</h3>
The home page also features a map interface that highlights the real-world location of each selected landmark or event.
Users can discover where historical events took place or where famous structures are located globally.

<h3>3. Augmented Reality (AR) Experience</h3>
Users can activate an AR view to place 3D models of historical structures in their surroundings, making history come to life.
By integrating historical models into the userâ€™s immediate environment, the application offers a tangible and engaging learning experience.

<h3>4. Music Integration</h3>
To enrich the user experience, the application features music playlists that correspond to different historical periods.
The carefully curated music helps create an immersive atmosphere while users explore historical artifacts or events.

<h3>5. Personalized Learning</h3>
The platform allows users to personalize their learning experience, choosing specific events or structures that interest them.
In future updates, users will be able to contribute their own content, fostering collaborative learning and community engagement.
